I've only recently started building websites using markdown and processing through Hugo.  So for a while I was trying out several different themes, trying to find the right fit. I liked  Ananke theme and then tried Docsy, but found Docsy felt like a mess trying to setup.  I finally discovered that simpler is better and have settle on my two favorite themes. Congo and Dimension. Because I mirror this site with another under my real name they are both using the Congo theme. I then build out pages for this site using ~~Atom~~ VSCodium and then while still in ~~Atom~~ VSCodium, just copy the page over to the other site and change the names to protect the guilty.  I suppose if you were to look at the source code for the other site, you would discover this one.  But honestly, until I change some fake 404 links under different domains, it's a pretty obvious discovery anyway. It only takes looking at the shared personal productivity site. My personal site is using the Dimension theme and though it is a very cool theme. It seems that it would not work well for documenting things or rather for reading those documented things.

### Update 05 September 2022

As you will notice I'm no longer using Congo or Dimension. Seems Docsy has grown on me a bit.
